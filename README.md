Justin Lee's Website
====================

I made a GitHub.io site using the principles of design, site map, wireframe, and HTML and CSS that I've learned thus far. I am not using Bootstrap or any other design framework for my site.

## Objectives
- Use the 6 Phases of Web Design to build a website
- Use wireframes to construct a website
- Use HTML tags to present content on a website
- Position HTML elements using CSS padding, borders, and margins
- Use CSS to add and format colors, fonts, icons, images, etc.
