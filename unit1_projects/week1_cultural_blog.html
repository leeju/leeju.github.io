			<h3>Exploring my values</h3>
			<p>Phase 0 Unit 1: Week 1<p>
			<p>	
				1. When you think of the times in your life where you've been satisfied, which of the following come to mind?</em><br>			
			</p>
			<p>
				Adventure, Confidence, Control, Creativity, Discipline, Education, Faith, Family, Financial Security, Friends, Freedom, Fulfillment, Forgiveness, Fun, God, Growth, Happiness, Health, Hope, Honesty, Humor, Independence, Integrity, Kindness, Knowledge, Marriage, Peace of mind, Power, Progress, Reason, Security, Self-reliance, Service, Spirituality, Strength, Success, Truth, Wisdom
			</p>
			<p>
				2. Pick one value and write a couple of sentences about why one of the values you chose is important to you.</em><br>
			</p>
			<p>
				Wisdom - "If the iron is blunt, and one does not sharpen the edge, he must use more strength, but wisdom helps one to succeed." - Ecclesiastes 10:10. This is a short parable about a logger who goes to work with a butter knife. Alot of times, I find myself doing the same thing. It's not a matter of working hard. A lot of people do. What is more important is whether or not you are working smart. 
			</p>
			<p>
				3. In general, I try to live up to these values:
			</p>
			<p>
				Adventure (3), Confidence (4), Control (5), Creativity (4), Discipline (4), Education (4), Faith (5), Family (4), Financial Security (3), Friends (4), Freedom (4), Fulfillment (3), Forgiveness (4), Fun (5), God (5), Growth (4), Happiness (3), Health (4), Hope (4), Honesty (5), Humor (4), Independence (4), Integrity (4), Kindness (4), Knowledge (4), Marriage (4), Peace of mind (3), Power (3), Progress (4), Reason (4), Security (4), Self-reliance (4), Service (4), Spirituality (4), Strength (3), Success (4), Truth (5), Wisdom (5)
			</p>
			<p>
				4. What was the last topic that someone asked for your advice on?
			</p>
			<p>
				My wife recently asked me to teach her how to drive. One piece of advice I offered to her was the 3 second rule. When driving in back of another vehicle, try to keep 3 seconds behind it by using a fixed position, like a traffic light or a tree, and counting to 3. Each second gives you more reaction time to brake.
