        <h1>Make your Blog Professional Grade!</h1>

        <p><em>Phase 0 Unit 3: Week 9</em></p><br>

        <p>In this challenge, I evaluated my website in terms of user design
        and user experience. I also used HTML tags to place content to a
        website and manipulated HTML elements using CSS. I enjoyed it a lot yet
        found certain parts to be tedious.</p><br>

        <p>I set up an hour with Gannon Curran to go over certain design
        aspects of my website. He is a professional web designer and walked me
        through his design process which he usually does with his clients. It
        was an immense help to me. He explained how I should roll out certain
        features to my other webpages. This included the blue menu bar and font
        choices. He also mentioned how my website's primary purpose is to host
        blog posts but that may change in the future. So I will keep that in
        mind. I decided to remove my Twitter link since I haven't really been
        on it to post. If I become more active in the future, I will add it
        back again.</p><br>

        <p>I really like <a href="https://www.coursereport.com/">Course
        Report</a>'s design, so I used it as my inspiration. I removed my
        beloved photo of <a href=
        "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2014/04/20/nyregion/20PANO/20PANO-custom1.jpg">
        Robert Courter</a>, wearing the Bell Rocket Belt at the 1964 World's
        Fair in Queens, demonstrating the personal transportation of the
        future. It was symbolic of my current preparation for and launch of my
        start in becoming a web developer. I also had an aerial picture of
        Lower Manhattan that symbolized the destination of my next
        landing.</p><br>

        <p>I also added a my picture to the landing page and removed it on my
        About page. I thought this would make my site feel more personal and
        give it more direction to what my website was about. I'm still thinking
        about some more ways to edit my About page and polish my whole website.
        I also really liked the font <a href="http://devbootcamp.com/">Dev
        Bootcamp</a> used on their website but found out it was not free. I
        decided to use a Google Font called <a href=
        "http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Montserrat">Montserrat</a>
        because it was similar and free. I held off from switching my paragraph
        font because I did not find Montserrat to be easy on the eyes. It is
        good for certain elements on the page but did not really work with
        others.</p><br>

        <p>The parts I found tedious were updating every single one of my blog
        posts to update to the current design. I started with fixing up my
        index page and decided that I wanted to use the index CSS for every
        single page on my website. I moved onto the About page and realized
        this was possible but decided to make the CSS blog template the source
        for the About page and my Blog posts. I also used this website called
        <a href="http://www.dirtymarkup.com/">Dirty Markup</a> to clean up all
        my HTML and CSS code. Other small areas include updating the HTML code
        tags with new font choices.</p><br>

        <p>Overall, I'm satisifed with the design and wish to continue
        iterating through my website to see where else the design can be
        improved.</p>
