        <h3>Chefs in the Kitchen</h3>

        <p><em>Phase 0 Unit 1: Week 3</em></p><br>

        <p>The more I learn about the Dev Bootcamp experience the more I am
        certain I made the right choice in choosing Dev Bootcamp as my
        launchpad for my web development career. I think I am cognitively aware
        of the kitchen versus table mindset and how it affects the culture of
        bootcamps and the students in them. What I desire to work on is to
        train myself to become less of the consumer mindset and more of the
        other mindset.</p><br>

        <p>When I think of the most succesful people I know, I say this to mean
        someone who brings the most value to an organization, he or she is
        usually someone with this sort of mindset. They step in to fix a
        problem instead of complain and do nothing. They value other people as
        well and can lead them to work together as a whole versus taking on the
        lone ranger role who thinks they can solve all the world's problems by
        themselves.</p><br>

        <p>When I paid for Dev Bootcamp, I was hoping to get a great handle on
        all the languages that would make me into a great web developer, but
        now I think I paid for a whole other experience entirely. I am certain
        I will be well equipped but I am a little worried that the Dev Bootcamp
        culture may not meet its high expectations. But I have a feeling it
        will and it is up to the instructors and students to make it work.</p><br>

        <p>I really hope the things I experience at Dev Bootcamp translates
        into the next company I work for. I hope the next company I work for
        looks for these qualities in their potential employees. I also hope
        that these companies put an emphasis on empathy and further learning
        for their employees. I would rather choose this over salary any day
        even though getting paid is still nice!</p><br>

        <p>I understand that Dev Bootcamp NYC has Meetups on Thursdays but I
        was wondering what other talks were made available to the students
        during their course of study at Dev Bootcamp. I would definitely be
        encouraged from these types of talks as well as motivated after hearing
        them. What kind of access is given to Dev Bootcamp graduates after they
        graduate?</p><br>
