				The more I learn about the Dev Bootcamp experience the more I am certain I made the right choice in choosing Dev Bootcamp as my launchpad for my web development career. I think I am cognitively aware of the kitchen versus table mindset and how it affects the culture of bootcamps and the students in them. What I desire to work on is to train myself to become less of the consumer mindset and more of the other mindset. 
			</p>
			<p>
				When I think of the most succesful people I know, I say this to mean someone who brings the most value to an organization, he or she is usually someone with this sort of mindset. They step in to fix a problem instead of complain and do nothing. They value other people as well and can lead them to work together as a whole versus taking on the lone ranger role who thinks they can solve all the world's problems by themselves.

				When I paid for Dev Bootcamp, I was hoping to get a great handle on all the languages that would make me into a great web developer, but now I think I paid for a whole other experience entirely. I am certain I will be well equipped but I am a little worried that the Dev Bootcamp culture may not meet its high expectations. But I have a feeling it will and it is up to the instructors and students to make it work. 
			<p>
				I really hope the things I experience at Dev Bootcamp translates into the next company I work for. I hope the next company I work for looks for these qualities in their potential employees. I also hope that these companies put an emphasis on empathy and further learning for their employees. I would rather choose this over salary any day even though getting paid is still nice!

				I understand that Dev Bootcamp NYC has Meetups on Thursdays but I was wondering what other talks were made available to the students during their course of study at Dev Bootcamp. I would definitely be encouraged from these types of talks as well as motivated after hearing them. What kind of access is given to Dev Bootcamp graduates after they graduate?
