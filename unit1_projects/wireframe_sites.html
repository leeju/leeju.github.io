					<a href="http://devbootcamp.com/">Dev Bootcamp</a> - I think the challenge here is to humanize the relationship between the provider and the customer. The website uses the video as the number one way to immerse the customer into the flavor of the bootcamp. It immediately gives the audience an idea of what to expect when attending this educational experience.

					<a href="https://plus.google.com/">Google+</a> - When I view social media sites, I tend to think of herding cats or organized chaos. Google+ solves this by boiling down all excessive elements. It becomes the backdrop for the content - like a dinner plate highlighting an exquisite meal ready for delightful consumption.By being simple, it gradually becomes noticeable and appreciated.

					<a href="http://feedly.com/">Feedly</a> - Feedly is by far my favorite RSS news feed reader. I think it mimics paper reading and removes the bulky website interface. One of the highlights of the app appears when you click open an article. Not only does the article pop up showing you a new view, it also dims the background as well. It reminds me of holding a Kindle Paperwhite.
