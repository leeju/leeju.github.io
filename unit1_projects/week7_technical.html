        <h3>SQL vs. NoSQL</h3>

        <p><em>Phase 0 Unit 3: Week 7</em></p><br>

        <p>Everyone loves a good debate: Ford vs. Chevy, Coke vs. Pepsi, Mac
        vs. PC. In the world of technology databases the debate revolves around
        the decision whether or not to embrace SQL databases (traditional
        approach) or NoSQL databases (contemporary approach).</p><br>

        <p>First, let me explain what a database is and how it is used.
        Databases are like Excel spreadsheets where information lives. Every
        time you visit your online bank to check your bank account balance you
        go into a database. It can have hundreds of billions of entries!</p><br>

        <p><b>Structured Query Language (SQL)</b> is a popular programming
        language designed to manage data held in a relational database
        management system. The usage of SQL includes data insert, query, update
        and delete, schema creation and modification, and data access
        control.</p><br>

        <p>SQL is found everywhere. Just start with your pocket. Smartphones
        have access to SQL and many apps on your smartphone use it. Banks,
        hospitals, universities, governments, small businesses, and large ones
        run it. Everybody eventually uses something running on SQL.</p><br>

        <p>The problem nowadays seems to be that everyone hates SQL. Database
        developers are dominated by the 'NoSQL' talk. They hate how SQL works,
        and are making new types of databases to replace it all together. So
        why should you learn SQL if everyone hates it so much?</p><br>

        <p>Well, I have read that the NoSQL movement is somewhat a reaction to
        outdated database servers, and a response to a fear of SQL borne from
        not understanding how to use it. But by learning SQL, you will learn
        important concepts that apply to every database system past and
        present.</p><br>

        <p>You should learn SQL because it is easy to learn enough to be
        educated about it. By becoming an educated, you will be able to make
        informed decisions about what databases to use, whether to not use SQL,
        and understand the many systems you work with as a programmer.</p><br>

        <p>SQL vs. NoSQL Summary</p><br>

        <p>In short, it seems like NoSQL was developed to deal with limitations
        of SQL databases (created in 1974). This includes scale, replication
        and unstructured data storage. My desire is to be educated about SQL to
        the point in which I can see where NoSQL can bridge the gaps.</p><br>
