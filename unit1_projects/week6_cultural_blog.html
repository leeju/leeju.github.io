        <h3>Stereotype Threat</h3>

        <p><em>Phase 0 Unit 2: Week 6</em></p><br>

        <p>Stereotype threat is a theory coined by Claude Steele. He defines it
        as such: a person's "social identity" has significance when "rooted in
        concrete situations." A person's social identity is defined as group
        membership in categories such as age, gender, religion and ethnicity.
        Steele identifies conrete situations as "identity
        contingencies"-settings in which a person is treated according to a
        specific social identity.</p><br>

        <p>Steels also finds that when a person's social identity is attached
        to a negative stereotype, that person will tend to underperform in a
        manner consistent with the stereotype. He attributes the
        underperformance to a person's anxiety that he or she will conform to
        the negative stereotype. The anxiety manifests itself in various ways,
        including distraction and increased body temperature, all of which
        diminish performace level.</p><br>

        <p>I'm glad that Steele's message was not without hope. He stressed
        that abilities are expandable and that there is no truth to allegations
        that a particular group lacks a particular capacity. It is important to
        stress that stereotype threat would continue as the "default setting"
        until steps are taken to counteract it. One way to combat stereotype
        threat is to nuture a growth mindset.</p><br>

        <p>Our minds are constantly monitoring and interpreting everything
        that's happening to us. This is normal and is what it means to be
        human. Stereotype threat is what happens when that monitoring and
        interpreting goes bonkers and the result of that is an exaggerated
        reaction of anxiety, depression, or anger. People with growth mindset
        use the information they collect to look for areas of learning and
        constructive action.</p><br>

        <p>Simply, this means changing our inner monologue. Someone with a
        fixed mindset says this: "This means I'm a loser." "This means I'm a
        better person than they are." "This means I'm a bad husband." "This
        means my partner is selfish." Instead, we should focus on questions
        like these: What can I learn from this? How can I improve? How can I
        help my partner do this better? This change is needed to counteract
        stereotype threat.</p><br>

        <p>Dev Bootcamp does a great job integrating feedback for its students.
        Feedback is given via students and instructors. I believe Dev Bootcamp
        does this because learning requires soliciting, receiving and
        integrating feedback. All of which is essential to nuturing a growth
        mindset. Thus, Dev Bootcamp facilitates the guiding of one's internal
        monologue from a stereotypical threatening one to a growth-oriented
        one.</p><br>
