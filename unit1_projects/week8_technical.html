        <h3>What is Rails?</h3>

        <p><em>Phase 0 Unit 3: Week 8</em></p><br>

        <p>David Heinemeier Hansson first released Rails as open source in
        2004. He created Rails while he was working on a project at 37Signals.
        In 2005, Hansson shared the commit rights to the project so anyone
        could offer up fixes, features, and improvements to Rails. In 2006,
        Apple announced that it would ship Ruby on Rails on its operating
        system, which released in 2007, and was a great milestone for the
        framework.</p><br>

        <p>So, what is Rails? Rails is a framework for web applications written
        in the Ruby language.</p><br>

        <p>Ruby is the programming language that you can use to tell a computer
        what to do, like copy files or build web pages or something else.
        Because it can do so many things, though, it isn't necessarily really
        good at any one particular thing.</p><br>

        <p>Rails changes that, by giving you a bunch of shortcuts to help you
        use Ruby to make web applications while accomplishing more than many
        other languages and frameworks. Web developers enjoy using it because
        it allows them to do things more quickly than traditional programming
        could - typing one line beats typing dozens!</p><br>

        <p>Let's take a look. If you wanted to write a link in Ruby you would
        have to type out dozens of lines of code to get it to make a link. With
        Rails, though, you can just type this:</p><br>

        <p id="code"><code>link_to("Dev Bootcamp",
        "http://www.devbootcamp.com")</code></p><br>

        <p>Rails is also good for building a complex website or app that
        involves a database. Not only is it good, but it is a fast and
        efficient way to build apps for the web. Many experienced Rails
        developers have said that it makes web application development more
        fun.</p><br>

        <p>Even though RoR is a relatively new framework, it has a vibrant
        community. Because of the community-driven nature of Ruby on Rails,
        there's somewhat of a culture around Rails development. These
        communities are where best practices are shared, reinforced and even
        questioned. As the Ruby community continues to grow, so working and
        collaborating with other developers is way easier than it was
        before.</p><br>
