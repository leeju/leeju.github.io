			<h3>Issues in Tech</h3>
			<p><em>Phase 0 Unit 2: Week 4</em></p>
			<p>
				I Googled "problems facing the tech world" and the first link from the search was a NYTimes article from April 5, 2014. It was titled "Technology's Man Problem." I clicked on the article and read the first sentence, "Elissa Shevinsky can pinpoint the moment when she felt that she no longer belonged." As I began to read the next lines in the article, I felt like I did not belong either. The ensuing sentences went like this: 
			</p>

				<em>"She was at a friend's house last Sept. 8, watching the live stream of the TechCrunch Disrupt hackathon on her laptop and iPhone. Entrepreneurs were showing off their products, and two young Australian men, David Boulton and Jethro Batts, stood behind the podium to give their presentation. "Titstare is an app where you take photos of yourself staring at tits," Mr. Boulton began, as photographs of women's chests on a cellphone flashed on the screen behind him."</em>

				I could not believe this was going on at the TechCrunch Disrupt Hackathon. An acquaintance of mine from church, Kevin McAlear a recent graduate of General Assembly, won part of TechCrunch Disrupt Hackathon this year. I went to check up on his work and was glad to see his team chose to work with CrunchBase's API and came up with a way to visualize the virtual paper-trail that flows between investors and startups. I also noticed that his team had two women out of the five member team.

				As a son, a brother, a husband and a future father, I would not want my mother, my sister, my wife and future daughter(s) to think of web development as an occupation where not only it is dominated more heavily by men, but also by men who objectify women's bodies through apps such as Titshare. I want them to feel welcomed into the world of web development if they ever decided to join and hopefully one day the ratio of women to men working in this industry will balance out.

			<p>
				Thankfully, I know a bunch of web developers in my church who would never treat women disrespectfully. I would love to see a girl in my church partake in this profession because I know that these men would gladly take her under their wing and help her just like they had helped me.
