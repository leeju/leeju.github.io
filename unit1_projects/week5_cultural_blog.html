        <h3>Issues in Tech</h3>

        <p><em>Phase 0 Unit 2: Week 5</em></p><br>

        <p>I Googled "problems facing the tech world" and the first link from
        the search was a NYTimes article from April 5, 2014. It was titled
        "Technology's Man Problem." I clicked on the article and read the first
        sentence, "Elissa Shevinsky can pinpoint the moment when she felt that
        she no longer belonged." As I began to read the next lines in the
        article, I felt like I did not belong either. The ensuing sentences
        went like this:</p><br>

        <p><em>"She was at a friend's house last Sept. 8, watching the live
        stream of the TechCrunch Disrupt hackathon on her laptop and iPhone.
        Entrepreneurs were showing off their products, and two young Australian
        men, David Boulton and Jethro Batts, stood behind the podium to give
        their presentation. "Titstare is an app where you take photos of
        yourself staring at tits," Mr. Boulton began, as photographs of women's
        chests on a cellphone flashed on the screen behind him."</em></p><br>

        <p>I could not believe this was going on at the TechCrunch Disrupt
        Hackathon. An acquaintance of mine from church, Kevin McAlear a recent
        graduate of General Assembly, won part of TechCrunch Disrupt Hackathon
        this year. I went to check up on his work and was glad to see his team
        chose to work with CrunchBase's API and came up with a way to visualize
        the virtual paper-trail that flows between investors and startups. I
        also noticed that his team had two women out of the five member
        team.</p><br>

        <p>As a son, a brother, a husband and a future father, I would not want
        my mother, my sister, my wife and future daughter(s) to think of web
        development as an occupation where not only it is dominated more
        heavily by men, but also by men who objectify women's bodies through
        apps such as Titshare. I want them to feel welcomed into the world of
        web development if they ever decided to join and hopefully one day the
        ratio of women to men working in this industry will balance out.</p><br>

        <p>Thankfully, I know a bunch of web developers in my church who would
        never treat women disrespectfully. I would love to see a girl in my
        church partake in this profession because I know that these men would
        gladly take her under their wing and help her just like they had helped
        me.</p><br>
