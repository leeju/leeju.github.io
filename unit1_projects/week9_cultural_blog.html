        <h3>Your Thinking and Learning Style</h3>

        <p><em>Phase 0 Unit 3: Week 9</em></p><br>

        <p>My Gregorc Thinking Style scores were 56 Concrete Sequential, 40
        Abstract Sequential, 16 Abstract Random, and 8 Concrete Random.</p><br>

        <p>Concrete: This quality enables you to register information directly
        through your five senses: sight, smell, touch, taste, and hearing. When
        you are using your concrete ability, you are dealing with the obvious,
        the "here and now." You are not looking for hidden meanings, or making
        relationships between ideas or concepts.</p><br>

        <p>Sequential: Allows your mind to organize information in a linear,
        step-by-step manner. When using your sequential ability, you are
        following a logical train of thought, a traditional approach to dealing
        with information. You may also prefer to have a plan and to follow it,
        rather than relying on impulse.</p><br>

        <p>Concrete Sequential - This learner likes: order, logical sequence,
        following directions, predictability, and getting facts. They learn
        best when: they have a structured environment, they can rely on others
        to complete this task, are faced with predictable situations, and can
        apply ideas in pragmatic ways. What's hard for them? Working in groups.
        Discussions that seem to have no specific point. Working in an
        unorganized environment. Following incomplete or unclear directions.
        Working with unpredictable people. Dealing with abstract ideas. Demands
        to "use your imagination". Questions with no right or wrong
        answers.</p><br>

        <p>Below are some ways I can work to expand the ways I learn and think.
        I used the other combinations to comb through what I need to do to
        become well-rounded. Which will lead to me being able to learn quickly
        and effectively.</p><br>

        <p>Analyze situations before making a decision or acting, and apply
        logic in solving or finding solutions to problems. Listen to others,
        bring harmony to group situations, establish healthy relationships with
        others, and focus on the issues at hand. Experiment to find
        answers, take risks, and use my intuition.</p><br>
