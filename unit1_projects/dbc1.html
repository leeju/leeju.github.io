            	My name is <strong>Justin Lee</strong> and I have seen my friends take the opportunity to learn to code and totally change their lives for the better. I wanted to see the same thing happen in my own life and enrolled in Dev Bootcamp where I learned how to build meaningful and beautiful things. Now having graduated, I am prepared and ready to use my skill set to continue to build things for organizations and other people. I look forward to working with you.

                <strong>Dev Bootcamp</strong> is an 18 week intensive programming bootcamp focused on teaching best practices in Ruby, Rails, JavaScript, Object-Oriented Design, Git, SQL, and Test-Driven Development. The first 9 weeks were spent remotely learning the fundamentals of object oriented programming and design while the last 9 weeks were spent on-site with the guidance and mentorship of world-class developers.
