        <h3>Dealing with Conflict</h3>

        <p><em>Phase 0 Unit 2: Week 4</em></p><br>

        <p>I had an emotional conflict this week with one of my accountability
        group members. It wasn't a direct conflict but an indirect conflict.
        One of my accountability group members went dark. No communication at
        all.</p><br>

        <p>Part of the requirements for one of this week's challenges was to
        work together as a group to research diferent built-in methods in Ruby.
        Since we were in a new unit, we were given new accountability groups. I
        am usually the first to act when it comes to gathering the group
        members together and setting up the communication lines so that we can
        all be on the same page.</p><br>

        <p>However, this week it was different. We were originally set up with
        5 people to a group when it should have been 4 people. As usual, I sent
        out a Google Group invite to everyone who was in our new group. 3
        people responded promptly and 2 people did not respond at all. I wasn't
        all that concerned about this since it was early in the week and I
        assumed both persons would eventually respond. On Thursday, out of the
        2 who did not respond to my Google Group invite, 1 person responded and
        then was moved to another group. The last person who didn't respond
        kept silent.</p><br>

        <p>And it stayed like that until Friday. As the end of Friday rolled
        around, I was concerned for the accountability group member who had not
        heard from her pairing partner the whole week. I took it as my
        responsbility to reach out to the last person to make sure all was
        accounted for. I sent him a quick email asking him to connect with his
        pairing patner and set up a time to cover one of the pairing challenges
        with her. I was sorta ticked that he had left us and his pairing
        partner in the dark. Then we received an email at later that day.</p><br>

        <p>So, yeah, I realized I made too many judgment calls. It turned out
        he had to travel and respond to a big family emergency and could not
        reply to us due to his circumstances. In fact, he was responding to an
        emergency that I was familiar with so I immediately empathized with
        him. In his email, he wrote about his family emergency, his computer
        crashing, his DBC work getting erased and a sincere apology for not
        responding sooner. He also said that although it was a difficult one to
        request he wanted our help.</p><br>

        <p>You see, he had the end of this weekend to get caught up with all 4
        weeks of DBC challenges or he would be asked to leave DBC. To me it
        seemed like a Herculean task to accomplish. I had thoughts about
        quitting DBC twice while working on this week's challenges so I could
        not imagine how he would feel about submitting all 4 weeks of work by
        the end of this weekend. I immediately formulated a plan and sent out
        an email.</p><br>

        <p>In the email, I mentioned my experience with his family emergency
        and in my concern offered my time on Saturday and Sunday to give him an
        opportunity to ask me questions about the work he was set to
        accomplish. I told him I was free on Saturday and on Sunday. It did not
        cross my mind how much of a sacrifice I was to make in order to help
        him out. I knew one of my fellow boots was stuck and I needed to find a
        way to help him. I gave him my number and specific times he was allowed
        to call if he needed anything.</p><br>

        <p>Now, the conflict I experienced was not a direct conflict with him
        but it definitely grew from his lack of communication. It was an inner
        conflict which had started in my heart. I had all these preconcevied
        notions about the type of person he was by way of his actions and did
        not conceive that he was not replying due to emergency circumstances -
        circumstances that I was familiar with.</p><br>

        <p>Here at DBC I'm constantly under the pressure to succeed. I think
        that pressure sometimes clouds my judgment of others and limits my
        empathy towards them. It drives me into consumer mode asking my fellow
        boots to serve me the way I want to be served instead of humbly serving
        others first. I've experienced that in my heart this week. I would like
        to leave this quote with you at the end of my blog post to remind you
        of an important lesson I learned, "Be kind, for everyone you meet is
        fighting a hard battle."</p><br>
