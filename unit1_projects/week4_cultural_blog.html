			<h3>Dealing with Conflict</h3>
			<p><em>Phase 0 Unit 2: Week 4</em></p>
			<p>
				I had an emotional conflict this week with one of my accountability group members. It wasn't a direct conflict but an indirect conflict. One of my accountability group members went dark. No communication at all. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Part of the requirements for one of this week's challenges was to work together as a group to research diferent built-in methods in Ruby. Since we were in a new unit, we were given new accountability groups. I am usually the first to act when it comes to gathering the group members together and setting up the communication lines so that we can all be on the same page. 
			</p>
			<p>
				However, this week it was different. We were originally set up with 5 people to a group when it should have been 4 people. As usual, I sent out a Google Group invite to everyone who was in our new group. 3 people responded promptly and 2 people did not respond at all. I wasn't all that concerned about this since it was early in the week and I assumed both persons would eventually respond. On Thursday, out of the 2 who did not respond to my Google Group invite, 1 person responded and then was moved to another group. The last person who didn't respond kept silent. 
			</p>
			<p>
				And it stayed like that until Friday. As the end of Friday rolled around, I was concerned for the accountability group member who had not heard from her pairing partner the whole week. I took it as my responsbility to reach out to the last person to make sure all was accounted for. I sent him a quick email asking him to connect with his pairing patner and set up a time to cover one of the pairing challenges with her. I was sorta ticked that he had left us and his pairing partner in the dark. Then we received an email at later that day.
			</p>
			<p>
				So, yeah, I realized I made too many judgment calls. It turned out he had to travel and respond to a big family emergency and could not reply to us due to his circumstances. In fact, he was responding to an emergency that I was familiar with so I immediately empathized with him. In his email, he wrote about his family emergency, his computer crashing, his DBC work getting erased and a sincere apology for not responding sooner. He also said that although it was a difficult one to request he wanted our help.
			</p>
			<p>
				You see, he had the end of this weekend to get caught up with all 4 weeks of DBC challenges or he would be asked to leave DBC. To me it seemed like a Herculean task to accomplish. I had thoughts about quitting DBC twice while working on this week's challenges so I could not imagine how he would feel about submitting all 4 weeks of work by the end of this weekend. I immediately formulated a plan and sent out an email. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In the email, I mentioned my experience with his family emergency and in my concern offered my time on Saturday and Sunday to give him an opportunity to ask me questions about the work he was set to accomplish. I told him I was free on Saturday and on Sunday. It did not cross my mind how much of a sacrifice I was to make in order to help him out. I knew one of my fellow boots was stuck and I needed to find a way to help him. I gave him my number and specific times he was allowed to call if he needed anything. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Now, the conflict I experienced was not a direct conflict with him but it definitely grew from his lack of communication. It was an inner conflict which had started in my heart. I had all these preconcevied notions about the type of person he was by way of his actions and did not conceive that he was not replying due to emergency circumstances - circumstances that I was familiar with.
			</p>
			<p>
				Here at DBC I'm constantly under the pressure to succeed. I think that pressure sometimes clouds my judgment of others and limits my empathy towards them. It drives me into consumer mode asking my fellow boots to serve me the way I want to be served instead of humbly serving others first. I've experienced that in my heart this week. I would like to leave this quote with you at the end of my blog post to remind you of an important lesson I learned, "Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a hard battle."
