			<h3>Ruby Classes</h3>
			<p><em>Phase 0 Unit 2: Week 5</em>
			<p>
				Classes can be used to create new objects. Typically, you create a new class by using:
			</p>
			<p id="code">
				<code>
					# -> This symbol represents an indent.<br>
					<br>
					class Name<br>
					-> some class describing the class behavior<br>
					end<br>
				</code>	
			</p>
			<p>
				You can also create things that the object knows and does. Things an object knows about itself are called instance variables. You'll want to initialize instance variable when a new object of class is created. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Here's an example:
			</p>
			<p id="code">
				<code>
					class Person<br>
					-> def initialize(name, age)<br>
					-> -> @name = name<br>
					-> -> @age = age<br>
					-> end<br>
					end<br>
				</code>	
			</p>
			<p>
				Now let's talk about how to create things the object does. These are called methods. In the class Person above, let's create a hello method that returns the object's name and asks "What's your's?"
			</p>
			<p id="code">
				<code>
					class Person<br>
					-> def initialize(name)<br>
					-> -> @name = name<br>
					-> end<br>
					<br>
					-> def hello<br>
					-> -> puts "Hi, my name is #{@name}. What's your's?"<br>
					-> end<br>
					end				
				</code>	
			</p>
			<p>	
				Now let's create a new Person object and call the hello method on it.
			</p>
			<p id="code">
				<code>
					person_new = Person.new('Justin')<br>
					person_new.hello # => "Hi, my name is Justin. What's your's?"			
				</code>	
			</p>
			<p>	
				You can create another new Person object by using the code above, replacing 'Justin' with another name and person_new with your own variable.
			</p>
			<p>	
				Now that we have a class, instance variables, and a method, I would like to raise an Argument Error: "You forgot to add a name." when someone forgets to add a name when creating a new Person object. This goes in the initialize area of the code.
			</p>
			<p id="code">
				<code>
					class Person<br>
					-> def initialize(name)<br>
					-> -> @name = name<br>
					-> -> raise ArgumentError.new("You forgot to add a name.")<br>
					-> end<br>
					<br>
					-> def hello<br>
					-> -> puts "Hi, my name is #{@name}. What's your's?"<br>
					-> end<br>
					end				
				</code>	
			</p>
			<p>	
				Therefore, if you create a new Person object without a name here is what you will get:
			</p>
			<p id="code">
				<code>
					person_new = Person.new('') # => ArgumentError: "You forgot to add a name."		
				</code>	
			</p>
