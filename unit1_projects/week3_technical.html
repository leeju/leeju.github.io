			<h3>Why is JavaScript so popular in web development?</h3>
			<p><em>Phase 0 Unit 1: Week 3</em>
			<p>
				JavaScript is one of the fastest growing, most marketable, most popular programming languages out there. And it is a perfect beginner language to start with. 
			</p>
			<p>
				JavaScript is easy to start with because it does not require any setup. All you need is a text editor and a browser. JavaScript comes installed on all modern web browswers. You need at least Chrome or Firefox. You can get started without any headache. You can get started by opening up your browser's "JavaScript Console" which is usually located in the developer section of your menu. 
			</p>
			<p>
				It also allows you to manipulate HTML elements, setup slideshows and even set alerts. One of the other uses for JavaScript even includes video games. JavaScript is a "object-oriented" scripting language. It is meant to interact with user behavior and change the markup or CSS on-the-go. 
			</p>
			<p>
				JavaScript is also really robust. It allows you to do many things. It was primarily a front-end language however it is now quickly becoming a back-end language. Two key languages allow this to happen: AJAX and JSON. There has also been an explosion of JavaScript frameworks in recent years. Backbone.js is a development framework with an MVC architecture kind of like Rails.
			</p>
			<p>
				JavaScript is the language that my mentor told me to learn. It is his bread and butter. Because of its accesibility, JavaScript is such a marketable language to have in your toolbox. I will probably invest most of my time after Dev Bootcamp learning and mastering JavaScript.
