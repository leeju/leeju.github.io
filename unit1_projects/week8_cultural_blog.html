			<h3>Pairing and Giving Feedback</h3>
			<p><em>Phase 0 Unit 3: Week 8</em></p>
			<p>
				At first, I was reluctant to pair with others to solve challenges. I did not think it would be useful to me since I like to work on my own. After having a successful pairing session, I quickly learned that pairing helps you learn more quickly in a short time than you could learn on your own. Two minds bring different ideas to the table. 
			</p>
			<p>
				For instance, when DBC asks you to write a Technical Blog and gives you a group of blog topics to choose from. There is no way you can go deep researching those topics on your own in the short amount of time you have in your week. You rely on your fellow boots to bring their learning to the table and in that sense you rely on each other to learn as a whole. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Peer-pairing also forces you to execute ideas and explain every single line of code in the process. It creates accountability and shines light on areas you need to grow. If you end up having to do a U-turn and start all over, at least you understand what works and what does not work. You and your pair can then move onto different approaches.
			</p>
			<p>
				The most rewarding experience I have had from peer pairing is the sense of accomplishment you get after you tackle a particularly hard challenge. You know you and your pair put in 100% and ended up with the solution on your own. It motivates someone like me to keep on stepping forward and gives me the confidence to trust my cohort in tough times. 
			</p>
			<p>
				I can not wait to get to Dev Bootcamp NYC because the most frustrating thing about pairing in Phase 0 is the internet connection and the digital wall. Having your pair right in front of you looking at one screen will help tremendously to cut time on the challenges. Also, there will not be any lag or digital interferences when you are pairing in person. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The second part of pairing that I benefit from is the feedback. I feel great when I receive a piece of feedback that is actionable, specific, and kind. I think our GPS Guides and Code Review Instructors have given us a good example to follow. This is one area I think the boots can all grow in. As a matter of fact, I need to also grow in writing my reflections and blogs.
			</p>
			<p>
				For the most part I expected my feedback to look like the Success Guidelines given for the Guided Pairing Sessions. These guidelines are separated into four groups: cultural success guidelines, technical success guidelines, general success guidelines, and general unsuccessful guidelines. I also found it helpful to keep a paper and pen nearby to jot down notes for later.
			</p>
			<p>
				Not that I have been guilty of this, but I would like to learn more about writing feedback that has less shit sandwiches in it. I do not think I have found anyone guilty of this so far but I would like there to be an environment of honesty when it comes to feedback. Like in the EQ & Feedback video I listened to, I found that feedback is the key to growing as a human.
