        <h1>Affirmation and Stereotype Threat</h1>

        <p><em>Phase 0 Unit 3: Week 7</em></p><br>

        <p>My Values</p><br>

        <p>Adventure, Confidence, Control, Creativity, Discipline, Education,
        Faith, Family, Financial Security, Friends, Freedom, Fulfillment,
        Forgiveness, Fun, God, Growth, Happiness, Health, Hope, Honesty, Humor,
        Independence, Integrity, Kindness, Knowledge, Marriage, Peace of mind,
        Power, Progress, Reason, Security, Self-reliance, Service,
        Spirituality, Strength, Success, Truth, Wisdom</p><br>

        <p>During the first week of Phase 0, I was asked to share my values.
        I've listed them above. This week I was asked to write about how I feel
        when I think about my values and if I think it can help mediate
        stereotype threat if I recognize I am in it. I've spoken briefly about
        my strategy to combat stereotype threat last week. I've stated that I
        will use a growth mindset to fight against anxiety, depression or
        anger.</p><br>

        <p>This week I will write about using how I feel about my values to
        combat stereotype threat. Looking at my values above, I see a lot of
        positive things. Generally, I tend to be a very negative person. As I
        mentioned last week, our minds are constantly monitoring and
        interpreting everything that's happening around us. And that is very
        natural for human beings to do that.</p><br>

        <p>However, problems arise when we interpret those things negatively
        and we have an exaggerated reaction. By thinking about my values, I can
        start using a new lens of which I can look for areas of learning and
        constructive action. I think values such as adventure, creativity, fun,
        growth, hope, knowledge, and reason will help me realign my trajectory
        towards progress.</p><br>

        <p>This is pretty much a crazy experience and I hope to learn more
        about Engineering Empathy and Growth Mindset during my time at Dev
        Bootcamp.</p><br>
