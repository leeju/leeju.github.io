				During the first week of Phase 0, I was asked to share my values. I've listed them above. This week I was asked to write about how I feel when I think about my values and if I think it can help mediate stereotype threat if I recognize I am in it. I've spoken briefly about my strategy to combat stereotype threat last week. I've stated that I will use a growth mindset to fight against anxiety, depression or anger. 
			</p>
			<p>
				This week I will write about using how I feel about my values to combat stereotype threat. Looking at my values above, I see a lot of positive things. Generally, I tend to be a very negative person. As I mentioned last week, our minds are constantly monitoring and interpreting everything that's happening around us. And that is very natural for human beings to do that. 
			</p>
			<p>
				However, problems arise when we interpret those things negatively and we have an exaggerated reaction. By thinking about my values, I can start using a new lens of which I can look for areas of learning and constructive action. I think values such as adventure, creativity, fun, growth, hope, knowledge, and reason will help me realign my trajectory towards progress.
			</p>

				This is pretty much a crazy experience and I hope to learn more about Engineering Empathy and Growth Mindset during my time at Dev Bootcamp.
