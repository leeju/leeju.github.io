			<h3>My Favorite Websites</h3>
			<p><em>Phase 0 Unit 1: Week 1</em>
			<p><a href="http://devbootcamp.com/">Dev Bootcamp</a></p>
			<p>
				I actually thought the website was warm and friendly when I first arrived. I was met with a video play button which I clicked and was introduced to the Founder of Dev Bootcamp. After, I found myself looking at all the links on the menubar. The ones that stood out most were "Dev Bootcamp - We're Hiring" and "Apply Now." I like the site because it is simple and minimalist. It is also very straightforward and arranges all the different sub-sections into color coordinated spaces. I think the site did well to sell a community and culture instead of just selling the program.

			<p><a href="https://plus.google.com/">Google+</a><br></p>
			<p>
				I chose this particular site because it is cleaner than most other social media sites. The person's circular profile picture and header picture are what you see when landing upon someone's Google+ page. I think the posts are well ordered - two posts per line. Google+ makes good use of pictures when someone posts a link to their "wall." It also makes it easy to determine the line between a post and a post's comments. I think another practical aspect is the option to have your homepage set to either Posts, Photos, or Videos.

			<p><a href="http://feedly.com/">Feedly</a><br></p>
			<p>
				Feedly is a great RSS reader. I migrated over to feedly when Google was shutting down Google Reader. I found that it worked well on all devices and presented articles in a readable and ad-free fashion. The first thing you see is the search bar and its message to type in a title or url of a site you love to read. Again, I'm drawn to the simple and clean user experience. RSS readers are really practical in that they take all the info you want to read and organizes it into a easy bite size news feed. I also like the side bar in which 	feedly reccommends similar websites to the one you are reading.
