			<p>
				I am a self-starter. I am self-directed and motivated. I am tenacious, often struggling earnestly and relentlessly with a problem, just because I have to figure it out. I am resourceful. I know when I'm stuck, and how to ask for help. I prefer the kitchen to the restaurant. I am a genuinely kind and good person, often inclined to give a hand. I see the best in others. To me, not only is the glass half-full, but I'm grateful that there is a glass in the first place. I love learning, and I really, really want to build cool things. I'm passionate about building a career as a software developer and I love the idea that my first job is going to pay me to continue learning.
